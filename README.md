Gallery in action
=================

Here are my sites powered by gallery framework:

- [Stalker Photo](https://stalker.toborek.info)
- [Galeria pewnego pstryka](https://pstryk.toborek.info)
- [Rafa≈Ç Story](https://rafal.toborek.info)
- [Z archiwum RP Foto](https://rpfoto.toborek.info)

Who and why?
============

Me - [Rafa≈Ç Toborek](https://kontakt.toborek.info) - and because I was in need of a flexible solution to build galleries for my photos. Framework was build to satisfy my expectations and for sure will not be suitable for everyone. But anyways... feel free to check what's under the hood and to learn something new.

May I help you?
===============

If you like my framework or you've seen my sites in action and you want me to help you to create a gallery for you then please do not hesitate to [contact me](https://kontakt.toborek.info).
